# 🎮 Unreal Engine GameDev – Mario-Style 3D Platformer

A **Mario-inspired 3D platformer game** developed using **Unreal Engine**, focusing on gameplay mechanics, level design, physics-based interactions, and professional version control practices using **Git and Git LFS**.

This project is built as a **learning + portfolio project** to demonstrate practical game development skills and real-world repository management.

---

## 📖 Project Description

This game recreates classic **platformer gameplay mechanics** similar to Mario-style games, where the player navigates through 3D environments, jumps across platforms, avoids obstacles, and interacts with the world using collision detection and physics systems.

The project emphasizes:
- Clean Unreal Engine project structure
- Core gameplay mechanics implementation
- Efficient handling of large binary assets
- Industry-standard version control workflows

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 Mario-style **3D platformer gameplay**
- 🕹️ Smooth player movement and jumping mechanics
- 🧱 Custom-designed 3D levels
- 🌍 Collision detection and environment interaction
- 📦 Large asset tracking using **Git LFS**
- 🗂️ Clean and professional repository structure

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Game Engine:** Unreal Engine  
- **Programming:** C++ / Blueprints  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Large File Storage:** Git LFS  
- **Assets:** Unreal `.uasset`, `.umap`, audio, textures

## 📁 Project Structure

```
UnrealEngine_GameDev/
├── Content/               # Game assets (maps, characters, materials)
├── Config/                # Engine and project configuration
├── Source/                # Game logic and scripts
├── .gitattributes         # Git LFS tracking configuration
├── .gitignore             # Ignored generated files
├── *.uproject              # Unreal Engine project file
```

### Excluded Directories
The following Unreal-generated folders are intentionally excluded using `.gitignore`:
- `Binaries/`
- `DerivedDataCache/`
- `Intermediate/`
- `Saved/`

This keeps the repository **lightweight and professional**.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Unreal Engine project architecture
- Player movement, physics, and collision handling
- Structuring a scalable game development repository
- Managing large binary game assets using **Git LFS**
- Applying industry-level version control best practices

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautam0222/UnrealEngine_GameDev.git
   ```
2. Ensure **Unreal Engine** is installed on your system
3. Open the `.uproject` file in Unreal Engine
4. Build and run the project from the Unreal Editor

> ⚠️ Unreal Engine is required to run this project.

## 📌 Version Control Notes

- Git LFS is used to track large Unreal Engine asset files
- Repository follows Unreal Engine recommended `.gitignore` rules
- Asset files such as `.uasset` and `.umap` are safely versioned

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Enemy AI and NPC behavior
- Collectibles and power-ups
- Score system and level progression
- Improved animations and sound effects
- Additional levels and environments
